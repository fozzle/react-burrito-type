React Burrito Type Component
============================

Hey you know [that cool game Burrito Galaxy](https://burritogalaxy.com/)? So much to love right? And the dialogue display is so fun.

So now if you want to have a cheap imitation of that you could use this React component! 

[Here's a demo](https://kpetrovi.ch/react-burrito-type-example), there's a lot of parameters to make your text go wild.

API
===

```
  text: string,
  verticalAmp: number,
  horizontalAmp: number,
  rotationAmp: number,
  verticalFreq: number,
  horizontalFreq: number,
  rotationFreq: number,
  style: mixed,
```

**text** - the text you want to show burrito style
**verticalAmp** - how high on the y-axis the letters will move
**horizontalAmp** - how far on the x-axis the letters will move
**rotationAmp** - how much the letters will rotate
**verticalFreq** - frequency of vertical movement
**horizontalFreq** - frequency of horizontal movement
**rotationFreq** - frequency of rotational movement
**style** - any other CSS styles you want to apply to the text go here

I've got nothing to do with Burrito Galaxy this is just a fan project.
